# Microsolvt
This project is a mini C++ solver of harmonic equation on some "regular" domain.

## What we need to do
1. Define a json file to specify the input.
2. Define and refine the grid to keep adjust to the domain.
3. Find out the linear equations about the discrete grid of the domain.
4. Solve the linear equations and store the solution.
5. Transform the solution to a proper format
